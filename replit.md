```

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses three main database tables:
- **users**: Basic user management (currently unused)
- **pension_calculations**: Stores pension calculation results
- **blog_posts**: Content management for educational articles

### Pension Calculator
- Implements Romanian pension calculation logic based on 2024 regulations
- Supports multiple pension types (standard, early partial, early complete)
- Calculates pension points based on salary ratio to national average
- Applies penalties and bonuses based on pension type and timing

### Content Management
- Educational blog posts about Romanian pension system
- Static pages explaining pension types, legislation, and planning strategies
- SEO-optimized content with proper meta tags

### UI Components
- Comprehensive set of shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- Accessible components following WCAG guidelines
- Custom Romanian-language content and terminology

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Users enter pension calculation parameters via React forms
2. **Client Validation**: Zod schemas validate input on the frontend
3. **API Request**: Validated data sent to Express.js backend
4. **Server Processing**: Backend performs pension calculations and stores results
5. **Database Storage**: Calculation results saved to PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
6. **Response**: Calculated pension amount returned to frontend
7. **UI Update**: Results displayed in user-friendly format with breakdown

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, ReactDOM, React Hook Form)
- UI components (Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons)
- Styling (Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority)
- State management (TanStack Query)
- Routing (Wouter)
- Validation (Zod)

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js with TypeScript support
- Database (Drizzle ORM, Neon Database connector)
- Development tools (tsx for TypeScript execution)
- Build tools (esbuild for production builds)

### Development Tools

- Serves static frontend files from Express.js in production
- Environment-aware configuration for development vs production

### Database Management
- Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations
- Environment variable-based database connection
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript types generated from database schema

## Replit Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

For production deployment on Replit:

```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Optional - Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Optional - Analytics and monitoring
ANALYTICS_KEY=your-analytics-key
```

### Replit Secrets Setup

Configure these secrets in Replit's environment:
1. `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (if using external database)
2. `SESSION_SECRET` - Secure session secret for production
3. Any external API keys for future integrations

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Development Phase:**
   - Code changes trigger automatic server restart
   - Vite provides hot module replacement for frontend
   - In-memory storage for rapid prototyping

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - Click "Deploy" button in Replit
   - Environment variables automatically applied
   - Static assets served optimized
   - Database connections established if configured

### Performance Optimization for Replit

- **Bundle Optimization:** Vite automatically optimizes bundles for production
- **Asset Caching:** Static assets served with appropriate cache headers
- **Database Pooling:** Connection pooling configured for PostgreSQL
- **Memory Management:** In-memory storage with automatic cleanup

### Monitoring and Debugging

**Development Monitoring:**
